Hi! I'm Didi, a third year studying computer science at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) under the [Turing Scholars](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars) honors program. Additionally, I'm minoring in Sociology and Economics and pursuing an interdisciplinary [Bridging Disciplines](https://ugs.utexas.edu/bdp) certificate in [Social Inequality and Policy](https://ugs.utexas.edu/bdp/programs/sihp). I'm interested in Natural Language Processing, AI Ethics, and education.  

I am the co-lead of [Freetail Hackers](https://freetailhackers.com/), an organization that plans [HackTX](https://hacktx.com/) and other events. Previously, I was the Outreach director and was responsible for ensuring our hackathons are beginner friendly and diverse. To that end, we created [The Ultimate Hackathon Starting Guide](https://github.com/kdesai2018/ultimate-hackathon-starting-guide) to help people prepare and begin their projects. I'm also a [Pod mentor](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate/student-support/360-connections/cs-pods) for freshmen CS majors where I help guide freshmen through their first year.

<!-- Last summer, I interned at Google on the [Flights](google.com/flights) team working on a data pipeline to suggest dates to travel during special events and holidays. The spring before that, I was at Facebook working on the [Messenger Privacy Team](https://www.messenger.com/privacy) adding in a new [privacy settings page](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/07/messenger-app-lock-and-privacy-settings/) and adding screenshot detection to [vanish mode](https://bit.ly/MessengerVanishMode) on the Android app. The summer before that, I was an [Engineering Practicum](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/) (now STEP) intern at Google, working on adding an action justification setting to the [G-Suite Security Center](https://workspace.google.com/products/admin/security-center/?utm_source=gsuite&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=securitycenterga) under Google Cloud.  -->
