As part of our final project for [CS 378](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/courses/fa2020/cs378.shtml), Natural Language Processing, my partner and I created this gendered text classifier. Below you can find our write-up for the project. The code is located on [Github](https://github.com/didizhou1/NLP-Final-Project).
